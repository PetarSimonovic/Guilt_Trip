## About
Sloth was designed to make walking fun through gamification. 

Players start with a "snuggle" of five sloths, each of which has a name, a personality and a hobby. There are more than 600 trillion possible combinations of sloths, so each individual is rare. If the player beats their daily step target, they'll receive a new sloth. Every fifth sloth has a distinct design. But if the player misses their step target, a sloth will die. 

The daily target is dynamic: it rises if the player hits the target and falls if they miss the goal. 

Sloths with a positive personality are upbeat and will encourage the player to keep walking. Neutral sloths will dispense sloth-related facts. Sloths of a negative disposition will lament their fate and try to guilt trip the player into walking through passive agressive comments and insults.
